<h2>Abstract</h2>

Agriculture is the backbone of main nations across the globe. In India, it provides employment to around 70% of the population and accounts for about 17% to the total GDP of India. It includes different processes like sowing of seed, fertilization, weeding, irrigation etc which can be tedious and requires large manpower. This project aims to develop an automated multipurpose agricultural robot which uses less power and human effort in the agronomic applications, thereby reducing farmerâ€™s effort. This work aims to design, develop and model the robot in the ROS platform with the help of Fusion 360 and MATLAB Simulink, which can sow the seeds, cut the weeds and perform irrigation without any manual control. The structural schematics and control algorithm for the coordination of various processes involved are studied. The robot is powered by a DC motor, the speed control of which is also studied. The structure of the robot was designed and developed in Fusion 360 and Solidworks. The various data and image processing algorithms for object detection and tracking for weeding purpose were carried out in ROS using OpenCV. The cost analysis of hardware implementation of the robot is also carried out.
